 My room is comfy and cozy(x) => My room is just so, you know, comfy. I mean, it's just so cozy(o)

2) I live in a studio apartment, so there's just one room. My favorite spot in my room is my desk. I have to study using my computer, so I spend a lot of time at my desk. Because of that, I decided to buy an expensive one. It's strong enough to hold my heavy computer, and the surface is so smooth that I could even sleep on it—haha! That's why my desk is my favorite spot in my room
3) I think I was expected to clean my room by myself. My mother thought that I had a responsibility to clean it, so once a week, I used an electric vacuum to do it. I felt happy to see the dust being cleaned out, so I cheered myself up. Because of that experience, I still clean my room once a week these days.
4) "As I mentioned before, my home is very small. It’s just so, you know, comfy—I mean, it's just so cozy. When I was a kid, my family and I lived in a bigger apartment, but I didn’t have my own room. My sister and I had to share a room, which was very uncomfortable. So nowadays, even though my home is small, I love it."
5) In front of my apartment, there is a building with a gym. It’s amazing because the whole building is a gym—wow! After dinner, I usually go to the gym at least, maybe, twice a week. My favorite part about the gym is running on the treadmill with a river view. The four walls of the building are made of glass, so I can enjoy the nice view while working out.
6) Actually, I had never been to a gym before. When I was a kid, there were gyms around my previous home, but they were old and smelled bad, so I never thought about going there. Nowadays, I enjoy going to the gym. The view is great, and the facilities are very new. And I mean... just so nice. I'm happy to go to the gym!
7) "I really like the hair salon in front of my apartment. It's a very small shop with only two seats, and just one person works there—she's the owner. She's a great hair designer, so after I go there, my friend always says, 'Your hair looks so nice!' I'm always satisfied with the result, so I always go back."
