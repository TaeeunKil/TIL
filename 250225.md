- Q
  - Describe your hometown and explain what makes it special to you.
  - What do you like most about your hometown?

- A
  - My hometown is a residential satellite city near Daejeon,
    so there are plenty of apartments in the area.
  - Since it was developed as a residential area, there are also many schools nearby.
  - When I go jogging on the weekends, I usually see lots of children spending time with their parents.
  - I really enjoy seeing children because they’re adorable and full of positive energy.
  - What makes my hometown even more special is that, despite South Korea’s low birth rate,
    there are still many children around, which brings a lively and cheerful atmosphere to the community.
