Hi eva, nice to meet you.
How are you? im pretty good. Thank you.
I'm feeling a little nervous because it's an interview and this is my first time taking the Opic test.
but i'll do my best to answer your questions.
first Let me introduce myself
my name is kil tae-eun but you can also call me Terry which is my english name.
I was born in 1995 and currently live in Daejeon, South Korea.
I am preparing for employment and participating in an IT bootcamp called SSAFY, which stands for Samsung Software Academy for Youth.
After completing this program, I aspire to become a developer.
In my free time, i enjoy cooking, especially making pasta.
That’s all for now. Thank you for listening.

영화

Let me see... I like most movies, no matter what.
I love watching movies on OTT platforms like Netflix.
Umm... actually, my favorite genres are fantasy and science fiction.
You know, I think fantasy and sci-fi movies are incredible because of their visual effects.
Recently, I watched Inception again, and I was overwhelmed by the visuals.
The story of the movie is obviously great, too.
I really hope more major fantasy and sci-fi movies will be released soon."

Ok let me tell you about my favorite park.
UM there's a big park in my town
It takes about umm.. ten minutes by walk. so it is close to my place.
i love that park because well, there are many different kinds of trees and flowers.
also there's a peaceful little lake right in the middel of the park.
and in front of the park, there is a big river with a walking path.
my best-freind loves the park too so we go there together weekend, whenever possible.
